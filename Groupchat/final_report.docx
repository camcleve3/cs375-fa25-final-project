# CS375 Final Project Report

## Group Chat System with OS Concepts

### Executive Summary
This document describes the implementation of a multi-threaded client-server group chat system that demonstrates key operating system concepts including IPC, thread management, synchronization, and resource management.

### 1. Introduction
The project implements a scalable chat server capable of handling multiple concurrent clients using thread pools, implementing efficient message caching, and providing group chat functionality.

### 2. Architecture
- **Client-Server Model**: TCP-based communication
- **Multi-threaded Design**: Thread pool for scalability
- **Binary Protocol**: Efficient structured communication
- **Group Management**: Multiple chat rooms support

### 3. Key OS Concepts Implemented

#### 3.1 IPC (Inter-Process Communication)
- Binary protocol for efficient data exchange
- TCP socket communication
- Message serialization and deserialization
- Structured packet definitions with headers

#### 3.2 Virtual Memory
- Simulated paging with fixed memory pool in cache
- Memory management strategies
- Buffer management for network I/O

#### 3.3 Interrupts
- Signal handling for graceful shutdown
- Client disconnection handling
- Error recovery mechanisms

#### 3.4 Deadlock Prevention
- Resource ordering using banker's algorithm concepts
- Lock hierarchy implementation
- Mutex usage patterns to prevent circular wait

### 4. Implementation Details

#### 4.1 Thread Pool
- Fixed-size worker thread pool
- Task queue with condition variables
- Efficient work distribution
- Resource pooling for better performance

#### 4.2 LRU Cache
- O(1) get and put operations
- Thread-safe implementation
- Configurable capacity
- Template-based for type flexibility

#### 4.3 Group Management
- Create, join, and leave groups
- Member tracking
- Targeted message broadcasting

#### 4.4 Binary Protocol
- Fixed header size
- Message type enumeration
- Length-prefixed messages
- Extensible design

### 5. Testing
- Unit tests for thread pool
- Cache functionality validation
- Integration testing scenarios
- Performance benchmarks

### 6. Performance Analysis
- Thread pool vs thread-per-client comparison
- Cache hit rate analysis
- Scalability testing results
- Memory usage profiling

### 7. Challenges and Solutions
- Race conditions: Resolved with proper mutex usage
- Deadlock risks: Prevented with lock ordering
- Memory leaks: Fixed with RAII patterns
- Error handling: Comprehensive exception management

### 8. Future Enhancements
- Audio/video streaming support
- End-to-end encryption
- Message persistence (database)
- Web-based client interface
- Load balancing for multiple servers

### 9. Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrates core operating system concepts in a practical application, showcasing thread management, synchronization, IPC, and resource management.
